  Project One was the development of a clock application.  This application ran in the console window and displayed a 12 hour and 24 hour clock next to one another.  I found that the area that I did particularly well in was the ability to use if and else if logic to work through the menu choices.  There is always room for improvment and my code could be enhanced through the use of funcitons.  This would clean up the code and make it more readable for someone else.  Also funcitons would make revisions easier for myself, if ever the need arose.  The peice of the code that I remember to be challenging was displaying both clocks simultaneously.  At first I thought that the clocks had to update in real time as per the clock on the users computer.  After noticing this would take quite a chunk of time to code, that I did not have at my disposal, I decided to not have the clocks updatein real time and only update as per user menu selection.  The resource I used to overcome this was the announcements in brightspace as the instructor said this would be fine for the sccope of the assignment.  The skills from this project that will transfer to other projects and course work will be a good base understanding of C++.  I will now have this program as a resource for furture assignments and will be able to reference it when needed as a giude to completing furhter work that may eb similar.  To make the program readable, maintainable, and adaptable I used industry standard best practices as per instructions.  Even if this was not a given instrucntion I would have done so anyway as clean code looks better and will be easier to trouble shoot.
